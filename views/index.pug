            p A. Either obsessions or compulsions:

            ol
              li 
                | recurrent and persistent thoughts, impulses, or images that are experienced, at some 
                | time during the disturbance, as intrusive and inappropriate and that cause marked anxiety or distress 
              li the thoughts, impulses, or images are not simply excessive worries about real-life problems 
              li
                | the person attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts, impulses, or images, or to neutralize them 
                | with some other thought or action 
              li
                | the person recognizes that the obsessional thoughts, impulses, or images are a product of his or her 
                | own mind (not imposed from without as in thought insertion) 
            p Compulsions as defined by (1) and (2): 
            ol
              li 
                | repetitive behaviors (e.g., hand washing, ordering, checking) or mental acts (e.g., praying, counting, 
                | repeating words silently) that the person feels driven to perform in response to an obsession, or 
                | according to rules that must be applied rigidly 
              li
                | the behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded 
                | event or situation; however, these behaviors or mental acts either are not connected in a realistic 
                | way with what they are designed to neutralize or prevent or are clearly excessive 

            p 
              | B. At some point during the course of the disorder, the person has recognized that the obsessions or 
              | compulsions are excessive or unreasonable. Note: This does not apply to children. 
            p
              | C. The obsessions or compulsions cause marked distress, are time consuming (take more than 1 hour a 
              | day), or significantly interfere with the person's normal routine, occupational (or academic) 
              | functioning, or usual social activities or relationships. 
            p
              | D. If another Axis I disorder is present, the content of the obsessions or compulsions is not 
              | restricted to it (e.g., preoccupation with food in the presence of an Eating Disorders; hair pulling 
              | in the presence of Trichotillomania; concern with appearance in the presence of Body Dysmorphic Disorder; 
              | preoccupation with drugs in the presence of a Substance Use Disorder; preoccupation with having a serious 
              | illness in the presence of Hypochondriasis; preoccupation with sexual urges or fantasies in the presence 
              | of a Paraphilia; or guilty ruminations in the presence of Major Depressive Disorder). 
            p
              | E. The disturbance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance(e.g., a drug of abuse, 
              | a medication) or a general medical condition.
